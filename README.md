Thai Stenotype on Android
Please Download this file for Thai Dictionary Database (In my code, it's called "trantext.txt")
And placed it on your device's storage. (OR other location, but you have to edit location in my code)
WARNING! This File is TOO LARGE. If your device has a few RAM. You should edit my code to read file only 5000-10000 lines (and edit in search function to find only 5000-10000 line-same number)
Thank you!
